Business Process Projects - Focus on the tasks that you and your team perform repeatedly to create a product or service for your stakeholder, sponsor or customer. Business process can be modeled as a flowchart, which details the tasks necessary to serve that business goal.

A business process starts with an objective and ends with the achievement of that goal, which provides value for the customer. A business process can often be broken down into smaller processes, allowing for divisions of labor.

In general, business process is broken down into three types.

Operational: This includes the core business and creates a value stream, such as orders from customers, opening accounts, manufacturing, etc. (Learn how operational excellence can make your team more productive)
Management: This includes such processes as corporate governance, budget and employee oversight.
Supporting: This includes those processes that support other processes such as accounting, recruitment, technical support, etc.
Business process as a concept has been around for a long time. As early as 1776, economist Adam Smith described it in a famous example of a pin factory, which explained the productive power of business process and labor division.

In the early 20th century, American engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor offered methods to improve business processes in industry. He focused on standardization of processes, systemic training and clearly defined roles for management and employees in his Principles of Scientific Management.

Peter Drucker, the management expert, focused on simplifying and decentralizing processes. This lead to outsourcing. He is also known for founding the idea of “knowledge worker,” which is a term to differentiate those from manual workers and applied knowledge management to process.
