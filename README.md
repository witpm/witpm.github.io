Welcome to the WIT Project Management Knowledge Repository!
WIT is a Project Management Consulting Company specializing in Technology and Software Development projects. Our goal at WIT is to enable SMARTER, not HARDER projects. We believe that SMARTER projects begin with SMART Project Goals. 

What Are S.M.A.R.T. Project Goals?
S.M.A.R.T. goals are a relatively new idea. In 1981, George T. Doran, a consultant and former director of corporate planning for Washington Water Power Company, published a paper called, “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. Way to Write Management’s Goals and Objectives.” In the document, he introduces S.M.A.R.T. goals as a tool to create criteria to help improve the chances of succeeding in accomplishing a goal.

What Does the S.M.A.R.T Acronym Stand For?
The acronym stands for:

S – Specific
When setting a goal, be specific about what you want to accomplish. Think about this as the mission statement for your goal. This isn’t a detailed list of how you’re going to meet a goal, but it should include an answer to the popular ‘w’ questions:

Who – Consider who needs to be involved to achieve the goal (this is especially important when you’re working on a group project).

What – Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish and don’t be afraid to get very detailed.

When – You’ll get more specific about this question under the “time-bound” section of defining S.M.A.R.T. goals, but you should at least set a time frame.

Where – This question may not always apply, especially if you’re setting personal goals, but if there’s a location or relevant event, identify it here.

Which – Determine any related obstacles or requirements. This question can be beneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking business, but you’ve never baked anything before, that might be an issue. As a result, you may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a baking business."
